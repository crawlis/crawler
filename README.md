Crawler is an inquisitive little creature that loves to sneak in every place in search of new URLs!

## Usage

Crawler is the Crawlis module that given an URL, will scrap the HTML found on it and extract new URLs. It gets its URL to crawl from a NATS instance and sends the URL it founds to another instance.
